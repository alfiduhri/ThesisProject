# ThesisProject

# This project consists of two main things: (1) LUA scripting, and (2) mathematical modelling using DATCOM and MATLAB/Simulink.
# For the LUA scripting, the important file SmartRTL.lua
# For some matlab file, the CasADI solver is used and the command:
# >> addpath("casadi-3.7.0-windows64-matlab2018b")
# must be executed first
